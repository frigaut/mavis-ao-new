All,

We're happy to report that the MAVIS project was kicked off at ESO (Garching) on Jan 31 & Feb 1, 2019. The meeting was very successful, with about 16-17 consortium members and 6-7 ESO representatives.

We also had a pre-kickoff meeting on Jan 29 & 30, with about 15 consortium members. Things are starting to really shape up, and we're getting organised.

We're on for a 15 months journey.
