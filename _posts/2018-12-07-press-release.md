The ANU and INAF posted Press Releases on MAVIS on December 7.

[Here](http://www.anu.edu.au/news/all-news/australia-leads-project-to-revolutionise-astronomy) is the ANU one, and [here](http://www.media.inaf.it/2018/12/07/mavis-astronomia-ottica/) the INAF one. The Aussie one is very Aussie-centric, not unexpectedly. This is quite important for us in Oz and we're proud of it.

These were picked up by a few media, like the [Daily Mail](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-6467433/Aust-boffins-lead-Chile-telescope-design.html), [the West Australian](https://thewest.com.au/technology/aust-boffins-lead-chile-telescope-design-ng-s-1910838), [Space Daily](http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Australia_Leads_Project_to_Revolutionize_Astronomy_999.html). ABC did an interview and was supposed to air it on Friday, but I never received notice that this was going to happen so I'm not sure they aired it.
