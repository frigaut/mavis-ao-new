Recently we realised that we need to do a better job at advertising MAVIS to the community. Especially the Aussie community. Richard and I put together [this talk]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/pdfs/MAVIS_Overview_lowres.pdf), that we showed yesterday to the SAMI science group that were gathering here at Stromlo.

Feel free to use this to advertise MAVIS within your own community (we would also appreciate if you let us know if you do this, just out of general interest). You can [ask me](mailto:francois.rigaut@mavis-ao.org) if you want a higher resolution version.
