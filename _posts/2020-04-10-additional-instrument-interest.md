The MAVIS team is putting an end to the phase A documentation review. It's been a while we know that there is significant interest in the community for additional instruments. The selected instrumentation covers the largest possible fraction of the science case, but not all. There is space for additional instrumentation, or for specialised instrumentation to cover specific needs.

We have had interest and the various proposal, expression of interest, or white papers and listed below (or will be as they arrive and/or are cleared for release). 

If you have interest in putting an instrument behind this fantastic MAVIS facility, be in touch.
