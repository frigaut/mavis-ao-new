Today, we just received notice from ESO that our bid was successful. MAVIS goes into phase A.

Now the real work starts. We need also to sign the agreement with ESO (which should hopefully not take too long, as we have already ironed out the legal stuff last months). Robin Arsenault, our contact at ESO, told me they are going to send us comments on our proposal, to be addressed at the Kick off meeting which will happen some time early next year (we're targeting end of January, beginning of February).
