The call for proposal for a VAOI (Visible Adaptive Optics Imager) is out; I received it today (one day after the workshop). Important dates are as follow:

* Acknowledgement to ESO due **25 May**
* Questions to ESO deadline: **5 September**
* Proposal due **14 September**
* Validity Period through **31 December** (which I understand as being the latest date for an answer from ESO).

This is a competitive proposal, up to two consortium may be selected.

Note 29 May: All consortium partners have given the in-principle go ahead before we sent the letter of acknowledgement to ESO on the 25th.
