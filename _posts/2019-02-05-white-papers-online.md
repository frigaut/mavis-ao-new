Following the successful MAVIS Phase A bid, we are very happy to release the wonderful collection of MAVIS White Papers to the public. Please follow [this link]({{site.baseurl}}/whitepapers) to access the individual papers.

A **HUGE** thanks goes to the many scientists from around the globe who contributed to this effort. We received 57 complete papers, involving 150 scientists from 47 institutes across 16 countries. The full collection of papers (almost 300 pages) was provided to ESO as an appendix to the bid documentation, with a summarised science case drawing from (and referring to) this appendix. This was a very important contribution to the success of the bid, and we now look forward to working with the community to refine the MAVIS science case during the Phase A period.

IMPORTANT UPDATE: The MAVIS science case is now [available online](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.09242).
