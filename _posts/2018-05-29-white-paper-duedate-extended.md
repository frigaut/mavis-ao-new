Because the ESO proposal is now due September 14 (delayed with respect to the originally anticipated mid-July), the due date for the white papers has been postponed to July 15 (from June 15). 

Instructions for white paper submission can be found [here]({% post_url 2018-04-11-white-paper-call %}). A list of currently submitted ideas for white papers can be found [here]({% post_url 2018-04-25-white-papers %}).

Please consider sending in your white paper; it is important.
