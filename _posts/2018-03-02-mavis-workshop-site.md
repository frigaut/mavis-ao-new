I have set-up a [website](http://mavis-ao.org/workshop) for the upcoming MAVIS Science and Instrumentation Workshop. I also finally sorted out the domain name issue: MAVIS has now its own domain name, [mavis-ao.org](http://mavis-ao.org). I have bought the domain for one year, so I should remember to renew it in a year.

The workshop pages have been stolen (with Sarah McIntyre --the author-- authorisation) and adapted from the [FAABExo workshop website](http://faabexo.anu.edu.au/) (really nice site). Using static HTML and google forms for the registration. These pages will need to be updated as new information flows in (e.g. program, participant, social events).
