We are please to announce the 2021 MAVIS Science Workshop, which will be **fully online**, scheduled for July 5-8th!

This workshop aims at bringing together the scientific community and discussing the key science cases where MAVIS will have a strong impact due to its unparalleled capabilities, as well as identifying the areas where it will provide unique synergies with existing and forthcoming facilities such as ELTs and JWST. The workshop is an opportunity to engage the community and push forward the MAVIS project.

More information about the workshop and how to register can be found on the [workshop website](https://indico.ict.inaf.it/event/1420/).
