##  What is MAVIS?

<img style="float: right; margin:0; padding:0; margin-left: 10px; width:50%; !important" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/mavis_at_nasmyth.png">

<strong>MAVIS</strong> is an instrument being built for the [ESO](https://www.eso.org/public/news/eso1721/)'s [VLT](http://www.eso.org/public/australia/teles-instr/paranal-observatory/vlt/) [AOF](https://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/develop/ao/images/AOF_Booklet.pdf) (Adaptive Optics Facility, UT4 [Yepun](https://www.eso.org/public/teles-instr/paranal-observatory/vlt/vlt-names/)). MAVIS stands for <b>M</b>CAO <b>A</b>ssisted <b>V</b>isible <b>I</b>mager and <b>S</b>pectrograph. It is intended to be installed at the Nasmyth focus of the VLT AOF and is made of two main parts: an <strong>[Adaptive Optics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_optics)</strong> (AO) system that cancels the image blurring induced by atmospheric turbulence and its <strong>post focal instrumentation</strong>, an imager and an IFU spectrograph, both covering the visible part of the light spectrum.


MAVIS will take advantage of the superb performance of the AOF (powerful Laser Guide Stars and Deformable Secondary Mirror). MAVIS will push AO toward the visible, and, using the Multi-Conjugate AO concept, will provide a 30"x30" wide field of view at an angular resolution close to the diffraction limit of the 8-m aperture. This is unprecedented in ground-based instrumentation. 

The figure on the right gives a 3D view of how MAVIS will fit on the AOF Nasmyth platform, opposite to MUSE.

The table below gives a summary of the instrument main characteristics, as it stands at the completion of the phase A.

MAVIS will be a unique facility. With an angular resolution of down to 18 milliarcseconds (close to 50 times better than the seeing limited conditions encountered without Adaptive Optics) and a powerful and sensitive post-focal instrumentation, MAVIS will be instrumental to bring answers to a number of astrophysical science questions regarding stellar evolution and star formation, physical composition of mid-redshift galaxies, how early galaxies assemble, or closer to us, weather monitoring on our solar system planets and moons.

The Science Case has been developed during phase A. A call for white papers was widely answered by the community, resulting in 50 white papers involving 150 researchers from across the international astronomy community. 

The science case was consolidated during the final period before the phase A review. It is now publicly available at arXiv.

### Resolved Stellar Populations Beyond the Local Group

<div style="clear:both; float:right; margin:0; padding:0; margin-left: 10px; width:50%; !important"><img style="clear:both; margin:0; padding:0; width:100%; !important" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/Screen%20Shot%202018-03-07%20at%206.47.21%20pm.png"><em style="font-size:90%;">Centaurus A, at a distance of 3.5Mpc, is our nearest early-type galaxy. The insert shows a simulated 2''x2'' thumbnail of a MAVIS-resolution image at one effective radius (~22 mag/sq.arcsec), with the corresponding input theoretical colour magnitude diagram, where colours represent different ages.</em></div>

The enhanced point-source sensitivity and faint confusion limit of MAVIS combined with the information-rich optical colour regime enable the exciting prospect of studying galaxies star-by-star out to the nearest galaxy groups and clusters, revolutionising our understanding of stellar populations beyond the Milky Way and Local Group. Through analysis of colour magnitude diagrams, degeneracies that hinder integrated light studies can be broken, allowing the first accurate star formation histories of objects that can only be found in these environments. The excellent crowded-field capabilities of MAVIS will allow such analysis to probe stellar density regimes that will not be accessible by, for example, JWST. Moreover, MAVIS will form a major enhancement to the E-ELT for tackling this science, complementing the outstanding sensitivity of the E-ELT at infrared wavelengths with the incisive diagnostic power of the optical regime, observed, crucially, at the same spatial resolution.

### Crowded Field Photometry & Spectroscopy

Access to optical spectral information of resolved point sources in extremely crowded fields, either through multiple optical colours or medium-resolution multi-object spectroscopy, opens new environment regimes for studying the age and chemical composition of stars. Such environments include the dense core regions of Milky Way stellar clusters and the Galactic bulge, where star formation processes may have differed significantly from the solar neighbourhood. The light-gathering power of the VLT will furthermore allow multi-object spectroscopy of such regions, as well as probing below the main-sequence turn off in star clusters of the S/LMCs.

### Precision Astrometry and Proper Motions

MAVIS will greatly exceed the crowded-field capabilities of GAIA, and with higher sensitivity than HST, will be able to observe fainter stars thus enabling accurate proper motions for more distant dwarfs and sparse Milky Way satellites and streams. The detailed dynamical properties of such systems are key for testing the predictions of different models of dark matter, and exploring the existence of intermediate-mass black holes. Combined with multiplexed radial velocity measurements and resolved stellar population information, this allows a complete chemo-dynamical picture of these long-lived low mass systems, allowing detailed archaeological studies of the epoch of reionization.

### Morphology of Young Galaxies

<div style="clear:both; float:right; margin:0; padding:0; margin-left: 10px; width:50%; !important"><img style="clear:both; margin:0; padding:0; width:100%; !important" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/clumps.png"><em style="font-size:90%;">Clumpy galaxies in the Great Observatory Origins Deep Survey (GOODS) field imaged with HST. From Elmegreen et al. 2009.</em></div>Rest-frame UV observations of galaxies at the peak of cosmic star formation (z~1-4) exhibit distinctly irregular morphologies due to ‘clumps’ of enhanced star-formation. These clumps appear to be significantly larger and more massive than typical star forming complexes in galaxies today, and may play an important role in building the bulges of present day galaxies. The limited resolution and sensitivity of current observations, however, prevent an accurate picture of the intrinsic size and mass distribution of these clumps. The combined light-collecting power and spatial resolution of MAVIS will be able to constrain the rest-frame UV morphology of high-redshift clumpy galaxies down to smaller spatial and mass scales than is currently possible, giving stringent constraints on models of feedback and bulge growth. Targeting low-redshift analogues of these galaxies with MAVIS will further extend this to even lower mass scales, giving insight into fragmentation scales in turbulent disks, with the possibility of medium resolution integral field spectroscopy to obtain dynamical and chemical insight into massive star formation clumps.

### Probing the Edge of Reionization

For probing the highest redshift objects, the optical capabilities of MAVIS will play a crucial role in complementing the outstanding sensitivity of infrared-optimised facilities such as JWST and E-ELT. While these facilities will be crucial in pushing the limits of candidate highly-redshifted (z>6) source detections that lie within the expected epoch of reionization, optical data with comparable sensitivity and (crucially) spatial resolution it will be essential to confirm the presence of the Lyman break in such systems. MAVIS can also open up new parameter space in understanding the properties of (spectroscopically confirmed) Gamma Ray Burst (GRB) host galaxies. GRBs are highly energetic events associated with the core collapse of massive stars, and thus provide a probe of star formation (as well as other host and IGM properties) that is independent of the host luminosity, and unique insight into the UV luminosity function near the epoch of reionization. Photometric properties such as size and luminosity are crucial to understand the nature of these sources, however most are missed with the insufficient sensitivity and astrometric accuracy of current facilities – both limitations that MAVIS will alleviate.


### Solar System Science

While much solar system science is focussed on probe missions, many aspects are better and more cost-effectively done from the ground. This includes long-term remote monitoring of planetary bodies for weather system information or volcanic activity; rapid follow-up of unexpected events; and building up statistical samples of e.g. asteroid morphologies.

## Adaptive Optics and Multi-Conjugate Adaptive Optics

<img style="float: right; margin:0; padding:0; margin-left: 10px; width:30%; !important" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/aoloop_diagram.png">

Adaptive Optics (AO) is a technique to compensate quickly varying optical aberrations in an optical system. In astronomy, telescope images from astronomical objects are blurred by atmospheric turbulence. By using AO, astronomers can cancel out these blurs and restore images close to the ultimate image quality imposed by the telescope, something called diffraction limit (and given by the ratio of the imaging wavelength and the telescope aperture diameter, &#955;/D). The diagram on the right illustrates the principle of AO: The light coming from a star through atmospheric turbulence, after being collected by the telescope, bounces off a *deformable mirror* (DM) that is shaped to compensate the corrugation of the light wave. A *Wavefront Sensor* (WFS) measures the aberrated light wave, and, through a *control computer*, is used to control the shape of the DM. The resulting *compensated* light can be captured by regular post focal instrumentation, imagers or spectrographs, with greatly improved clarity (angular resolution) with respect to the natural seeing limit imposed by atmospheric turbulence.


<img style="clear:both; float: right; margin:0; padding:0; margin-top:10px; margin-left: 10px; width:50%; !important" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/mcao_principle.gif">
One of the limitation of AO is that the correction is only valid in a very small patch of sky (depending on the wavelength, from a few arcsec to a few tens of arcsec). *Multi-Conjugate Adaptive Optics*, or MCAO, solves this problem by using a series of DMs to compensate the turbulence in volume. To do so, MCAO uses several guide stars to measure the light wave aberrations in several directions, and using a tomographic reconstruction process, determine the best commands to apply to the DMs, as illustrated in the figure on the right.

The net result of MCAO is that the corrected field of view is much enlarged with respect to what can be produced with regular AO, typically by a factor of 10 to 20 in area. In addition, one can tweak the uniformity of the output image quality (IQ) to obtain the most uniform IQ, something important for the extraction of quantitative photometry and astrometry from the post-focal instrumentation data (images and spectra).
